#### 1. [Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each characters in string](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DS-Algorithms/Q1.js)

#### 2. [Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman. Assume letters in string are in lowercase](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DS-Algorithms/Q2.js)

#### 3. [Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DS-Algorithms/Q3.js)

#### 4. [Write a function which accepts an array. First value in array is a string and second one is string of words separated by comma. Return an array which contains two words which are substring of the string and presented in seond string](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DS-Algorithms/Q4.js)

#### 5. [Write a function which accepts an array and target integer. Find the index of elements fro array to get target value by adding two elements from array](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DS-Algorithms/Q5.js)
