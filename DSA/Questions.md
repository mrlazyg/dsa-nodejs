#### 1. [Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each characters in string](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DSA/Q1.js)

#### 2. [Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman. Assume letters in string are in lowercase](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DSA/Q2.js)

#### 3. [Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DSA/Q3.js)

#### 4. [Write a function which accepts an array. First value in array is a string and second one is string of words separated by comma. Return an array which contains two words which are substring of the string and presented in seond string](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DSA/Q4.js)

#### 5. [Write a function which accepts an array and target integer. Find the index of elements fro array to get target value by adding two elements from array](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DSA/Q5.js)

#### 6. [Find the sub-array of specified length in a way that the sum is maximum](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DSA/Q6.js)

#### 7. [Find factorial upto nth term in recursive](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DSA/Q7.js)

#### 8. [Write function for Recaman's Sequence](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DSA/recaman_sequence.js)

#### 8. [We have a list of lexicographically sorted strings A. We also have a string B. We need the first and last indexes of strings from A which are having their prefix as B. A can contain duplicate strings. Return [-1, -1] if no such prefix exists. A = [a, aa, aab, b, bb, bba, bbb], B = bb. Output: [4, 6]](https://github.com/mrlazyg/ds-problems-solutions/blob/master/DSA/prefix_string.js)
